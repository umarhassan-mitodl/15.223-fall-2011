This group project is due on Ses #10, and will count for 25% of the grade. You will need to write a 10–15 page report on the business environment in one country as it is likely to look after the 2008–2009 global crisis. You can be optimistic or pessimistic, but you should ground your assessment in data of some kind. This is a group assignment. You can work in teams of 3–4 people on this project.
